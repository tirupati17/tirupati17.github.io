<h4>What is Jekyll?</h4>
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under an open source license.

> Instead of using databases, Jekyll takes the content, renders Markdown or Textile and Liquid templates, and produces a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache HTTP Server, Nginx or another web server.

> Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, a GitHub feature that allows users to host websites based on their GitHub repositories.

<h4>Meet Poole</h4>

[Poole](http://getpoole.com)  is the butler for Jekyll, the static site generator. 

> It's designed and developed by [@mdo](https://markdotto.com) to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example templates, pages, posts, and styles.

<h4>Hyde?</h4>

[Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) is a brazen two-column Jekyll theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on Poole, the Jekyll butler.

> Hyde is a theme built on top of Poole, which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setupâ€”just download and start the Jekyll server. See the Poole usage guidelines for how to install and use Jekyll.

<h4>Finally Hydeout?</h4>

[Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) updates the original Hyde theme for Jekyll 3.x and adds new functionality.

> Hydeout is available as the `jekyll-theme-hydeout` Ruby Gem. Add `gem "jekyll-theme-hydeout", "~> 3.4"` to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`

Hydeout uses pagination, so if you have an `index.md`, you'll need to swap it with an `index.html` that uses the index layout:
