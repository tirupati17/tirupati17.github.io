When setting up a Home Assistant Docker container, you might encounter issues with port visibility, meaning that even if your container is running perfectly, you can’t access it through the assigned port. This article walks through resolving such issues, focusing on the Home Assistant Docker container.

#### **Background**
Home Assistant is an open-source home automation platform that focuses on privacy and local control. It runs on most systems and provides the capability to observe, control, and automate devices around the home. The official Home Assistant Docker image is `homeassistant/home-assistant`.

#### **Scenario**
The user attempted to run the container using the following command:
```sh
docker run -d --name homeassistant -v ~/homeassistant:/config --net=host homeassistant/home-assistant
```

However, accessing the Home Assistant UI through port `8123` was not successful.

#### **Resolution**
A modification of the run command to explicitly publish the port resolved the issue:
```sh
docker run -p 8123:8123 homeassistant/home-assistant:latest
```

#### **Solution Explanation**
When using `--net=host`, the container shares the host's network stack, and the `-p` (publish) flag is not valid, as all ports are implicitly published. However, this can sometimes lead to port visibility issues due to conflicts or restrictions in the network environment.

Explicitly publishing the port using `-p 8123:8123` makes it accessible to the host and avoids conflicts, making the Home Assistant UI accessible via `http://your_host_ip:8123`.

#### **Additional Debugging Steps**
If you still encounter issues accessing the port, consider the following steps:

1. **Check if the Container is Running:**
   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```

2. **Review the Container Logs:**
   ```sh
   docker logs homeassistant
   ```

3. **Inspect the Container’s Network and Port Settings:**
   ```sh
   docker inspect homeassistant
   ```

When deploying Home Assistant or any other services in a Docker container, being explicit about port mappings can help avoid accessibility issues. While using `--net=host` simplifies the networking setup by sharing the host's network, it may lead to unintended port conflicts or visibility issues.
