`Citysocializer - Lead iOS Developer`
> 1 Aug 2015 - Present (Almost 2.3 years)

Well, Working independently at Celerstudio has realize me that ideas, products, startups etc etc are good things but for monthly expenses parallelly you really need something `which is profitable` (product) `or` you are working for someone `who is profitable`(employer) and Yep luckily for that I've `Citysocializer`(my employer) subscription-based social networking website & app based in London  where I'm working as Lead iOS Developer since Aug 2015 via remotely from India.

I'm really enjoying working for Citysocializer as part-time developer (yep working only 2 days in a week). Because of this, on remaining days, I'm easily focusing on my own product work under Celerstudio.

`CelerStudio - Founder`
> 1 Jan 2015 - Present (Almost 3 years)

<!-- <p>
    After spending almost 10 months at CelerApps (11 March 2014 - 31 Dec 2014) I realize that there is something which I want to transform i.e the amount of time spend on a product because without your dedicated effort it's not possible to build any perfect product.
</p>
<p>
    At CelerApps doing consulting and client work, it's a little bit difficult for me to create something as there are so many activities to do while you are working as a consulting company but I love working for CelerApps under RedPanda Innovation Lab all people are very talented and loveable.
</p>
<p>
    So, again after a lot of discussion with my colleagues at CelerApps I decided to leave CelerApps as it is under RedPanda Innovation Lab and started my own independent product development firm <a href="http://celerstudio.com" target="_blank">CelerStudio</a>.
</p> -->
<p>
    From 1st of January 2015,  I started working on CelerStudio products and Yep, there is no office for CelerStudio I am working from different different co-working spaces (<a href="http://theplayce.in" target="_blank">The Playce</a>, <a href="http://workloft.in" target="_blank">Workloft</a>, <a href="http://workamp.co" target="_blank">Workamp</a>, <a href="http://of10.in" target="_blank">Of10</a>) basically a startup campuses where entrepreneurs together building something for themselves.

    Letâ€™s see whether my decision will become right or wrong but whatever its all about experience and someone said

</p>

`CelerApps - Partner (Lead iOS Developer)`
> 11 Mar 2014 - 31 Dec 2014 (10 month)

<p>At CelerApps along with Redpanda Team with a lot of Karan support, I have learned a lot from him what exactly the entrepreneur means to me and I found that it's not as easy as I thought but remember <span style="font-weight:bold;">"in life nothing is simple as simpler".</span></p>
<p>Remember for your survive and monthly expenses you have to do consulting, without consulting it's not possible to generate money except if you have some amazing product but currently, we don't have it.</p>
<p>The reason behind CelerApps that we guys who really want to build some product with earning capabilities along with consulting till date when we are capable of surviving through our product.</p>
<p>But building a good product it's not a simple thing but we tried along with our consulting work.</p>
<p>After few hard work, we build WhatScore(Watch score along with chat) an Extended Version of Cricket Live App and we failed but always remember <span style="font-weight:bold;">"failure is a first step for success."</span> </p>
<p>Now at CelerApps we are doing great with consulting work we build dozens of mobile apps for differents brands & together 40+ All over apps experience and everyone here handling his entrepreneurship role under Karan guideline.</p>
<p>What next for product.. yep we again trying our luck with one awesome idea and will always try our luck with dedicated hard work remember <span style="font-weight:bold;">"Each mistake teaches you something new about yourself. There is no failure, remember, except in no longer trying. It is the courage to continue that counts."</span></p>
<p>P.S: I mentioned 11 March which is the start date of CelerApps because at that day http://celerapps.com site becomes live.</p>

`RedPanda Innovation Lab - Lead iOS Developer`

<p>After spending almost 2 years at Indigo Consulting I thought let's do something different and then I joined Redpanda. The place where I found most intelligent people ever and still learning a lot every day.</p>
<p>But after a few month, I feel I want to do something with my own ideas like we did in indigo through unofficial CelerApps.Then Karan (Founder of Redpanda) suggested me lets start your own company under RedPanda Venture and do what you really want to do.</p>
<p>Then after a formal agreement with Karan I called Shivam(Android Developer) and Saya(Android Developer) from Indigo Consulting & they joined me along with Pooja as Windows Developer.</p>
<p>So we finally found CelerApps here at Redpanda as RedPanda Venture.</p>
