Hello, Hope all good!!

I'm Tirupati Balan, An iOS Developer and Internet Entrepreneur.

<p class="message">
  Well, I said iOS Developer because I spend a lot of my professional time by developing iOS apps specially in Objective-C (now swift) and Internet Entrepreneur may be because I've actively worked on or say love to work or love to manage or love to build something useful (apps or sites) in this internet-dependent world.
</p>
As an iOS Developer, I've built around 40+ apps for clients via freelancing, direct clients and my agencies tenure.

As an Internet Entrepreneur, have executed dozens of apps for end users.
