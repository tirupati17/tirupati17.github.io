Hello, Hope all good!!

I'm Tirupati Balan, An iOS Developer and Internet Entrepreneur.

<!-- <p class="message">
  Well, I said iOS Developer because I spend a lot of my professional time by developing iOS apps specially in Objective-C (now swift) and Internet Entrepreneur may be because I've actively worked on or say love to work or love to manage or love to build something useful (apps or sites) in this internet-dependent world.
</p>
As an iOS Developer, I've built around 40+ apps for clients via freelancing, direct clients and my agencies tenure.

As an Internet Entrepreneur, have executed dozens of apps for end users.

<h4>@quickupdate [April 2018]</h4>
> For the right opportunity I am definitely willing to relocate in London, US, Dubai, Thailand or any suitable country for work if any one of you ready to sponsor my visa for that country. Basically want both change and challenge (Want to work under good full stack influencer or say tech lead or say a good mentor). I've been working alone for about last 3 years, now seriously I want to get out of this.  -->
